   ===========================

   1) Victoria elections. Use the official election date, and the winner label you prefer.
      The code will assume the winner forms government from that date onward until the
      next election date. (That is usually correct for VIC; mid-term changes still resolve
      to the party label.)

   DATE FORMAT: 'YYYY-MM-DD'

   party: use anything with "Labor" for Labor red; everything else maps to Coalition blue by default.
   You can customize colors in app.js if you want finer control.

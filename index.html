        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>These charts and table data show information around AFL grand finals from 1982 to current.</p>
        <p>Last Updated: <span class="updateDate">14 September 2025</span></p>
        <p>This was created to look at scores, games and results of grand finals in line with:
            <ul>
                <li>The expansion of the then VFL into other states and then a national competition, the AFL.</li>
                <li>When did teams outside of Victoria start playing and also win the grand final.</li>
                <li>What Victorian political party was in government when the grand final took place.</li>
                <li>Who the Premier was at the time of the grand final and who they support (if known).</li>
                <li>If there was any obvious alignment of:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Political party to scores.</li>
                        <li>Political party to religious sect (club) location.</li>
                    </ul>

        <h3>Chart 11: Grand Finals by Month</h3>
        <div id="chart12" class="hc"></div>
        <p>This chart shows that in more than 80% of grand finals in this timeframe are played in September.</p>
        <p>This information is framed around a traditional grand final in September, usually played on the last Saturday in September.</p>
        <p>This is immortalised in the song by Mike Brady, released in 1980: "One Day in September". Of the two grand finals not covered in this data but relative to song release, both were the last Saturday of September in their respective years:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1980 - 27 September 1980.</li>
            <li>1981 - 26 September 1981.</li>

          <p>This chart shows when the grand final gets played during the year. 
          <p>There are two major outlier dates for grand finals in this timeframe:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>2000 - The season schedule and subsequent finals was early than usual to avoid a clash with the 2000 Summer Olympics, held in Sydney, Australia.
                <ul>
                    <li>This is also the only time in this timeframe that a September grand final was NOT played on the last Saturday of September.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>2020 - The season was impacted by COVID-19. Restrictions, player bubbles and a reduced season pushed the season and grand final back.</li>
